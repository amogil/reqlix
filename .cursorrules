# Fluxgate Cursor Rules

**ALWAYS start with the requirements documentation:**

- Read `docs/development/requirements/AGENTS.md` - this is the single source of truth for all requirements-related information
- It contains everything you need: how requirements are structured, how to find them, how to update them, how to write tests, and how to validate changes
- Follow the workflows and use the automated commands provided in that file

## General Rules

- Do not commit changes to Git unless the user explicitly requests and approves it.
- Always draft a plan, confirm it with the user, and only then modify code.
